# My Personal Website

**Available at [windybank.net](https://windybank.net)**

## About

This site is created using [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js]), allowing me fast website loading through sever side rendering.

It's a personal site, highlighting work I have done personally and professionally, along with providing links to all the platforms I am on, and also hosting a small blog.

## Setup

Clone this repo, and then run `npm run dev` to setup a development version of the site.
